/ Given a pointer 'p' to the prevlen info that prefixes an entry, this   function returns the difference in number of bytes needed to encode   the prevlen if the previous entry changes of size.     So if A is the number of bytes used right now to encode the 'prevlen'   field.     And B is the number of bytes that are needed in order to encode the   'prevlen' if the previous element will be updated to one of size 'len'.     Then the function returns B - A     So the function returns a positive number if more space is needed,   a negative number if less space is needed, or zero if the same space   is needed. /
